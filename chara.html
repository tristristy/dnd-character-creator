                    <p class="firstpara">Your first step in playing an adveturer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world.</p>

                    <p>Before you dive into it, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a coreageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent clerif, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afat. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of tone of those races. Do you want your character to the the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. Think about it and see what catches your interest.</p>

                    <p>Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.</p>

                    <h4 id="xraces">Races</h4>

                    <p>Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid specied in the D&D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. The race you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry.</p>

                    <p>Your character's race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain wepons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes. For Example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun too. Half-Orc paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, cam be unusual but memorable characters.</p>

                    <h4 id="xclass">Classes</h4>

                    <p>Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents they posess, and the tactics they are most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features - capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other lasses. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tool. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>

                    <p id="xsubclass">Within every class, there are subclasses that one might choose from to better fit their adventurer and the backstory made around them. Each subclass does something different from the other and specializes in a different means of study, skill, or combat. For example, a storm herald barbarian specializes in the environment around you and manipulation of it to your benefit while a totem warrior is more of a spiritual path.</p>

                    <h4 id="xequip">Equipment</h4>

                    <p>When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items in game. You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during their upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You ight even have stolent your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps. Or you could have fought against someone and pilfered their body of their equipment. Whatever you decide, your strength stats determine how much your character is able to carry and each piece of equipment has a weight to it.</p>

                    <h4 id="xspells">Spells</h4>

                    <p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic, suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desure effect - in most cases, all in the span of seconds. Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose of remove contision, drain life energy away, and resture life to the dead. Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multieverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in the minds of dead gods. Or they might somdeday be be reinvented by a character who has ammassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p>

                    <p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips - simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote - are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that level. Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p>

                    <p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, they must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions. In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the charcter's level.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. When a character casts a spell, they expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size - small for 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of a higher level. Some cahracters and mosnters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots.</p>
